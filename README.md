# Multi-Modal-Transportation-Problem
# Transportation Optimization Project

This repository contains two implementations (AMPL and Python) for solving a **balanced transportation problem**, aimed at minimizing total transportation cost between supply cities and ports. The project demonstrates multiple solution techniques including North-West Corner, Least Cost, Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM), Stepping Stone, and MODI method.

## üîç Objective

The objective of this project is to:
- Minimize transportation cost while meeting supply and demand constraints.
- Compare classical transportation algorithms (MODI, Stepping Stone) with LP-based solutions (AMPL Simplex).
- Demonstrate the implementation of these algorithms in both modeling and programming environments.
